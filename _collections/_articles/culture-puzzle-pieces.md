Culture isn't something you fit pieces to like a puzzle. Culture is what your company is - if you do good work and treat people good then you have good culture. You do bad work and it's crazy at work then you have bad culture. Whether it's a new team member or customer, if you're gauging them based on "culture fit" you're missing the mark - because they're not a puzzle piece.

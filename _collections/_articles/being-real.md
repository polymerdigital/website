Most web design firms pretend to be these hip and awesome places to work for/with. Really though, what they have is a culture of chaos. We're working on bucking this trend by being real. Real with ourselves. Real with our team. Real with our customers. When people work with us they'll always know where their project stands. Be wary of the company putting on the happy face when really everyone's hair is on fire - you'll adopt their headaches and failures too if you work with them. We're changing the agency model - by being real.

When you're picking a web design partner (or any vendor for any service really) it's important to beware of teams that self aggrandize. These teams pump themselves up to be more than they really are. A key red flag is when you have more managers/directors than actual production workers. Another is when a 10 person team has a CEO or COO. It's not like they're leading a corporation and reporting to a board of directors. If these businesses can't be real with themselves could they ever be real with their customers? 

Fortunately, Polymer Digital is a humble business focused in reality. We MINIMIZE titles, clearly DEFINE our ROLES, and get shit done.

This warrants an actual article someday but I wanted to collect some thoughts on Corporate Stockholm Syndrome. It’s basically a situation where a business stinks but an employee or employees are so attached to it they can’t see that and it becomes a detriment to their own health. They rationalize their plight by telling themselves that it’ll get better someday if they keep grinding. In their minds they’ve already invested so much blood, sweat and tears into it they need to see it through. Unfortunately since the business stinks the leadership usually play into this for the employees as well. They beat the company culture drum over and over to cultivate loyalty. Unfortunately in these cases it’s more like CULTure. They also have perks to draw them in while neglecting actual real benefits. Who needs the option to work from home when there’s a foosball table in the office? 

Thankfully it doesn’t always have to be this way. I’m building a REAL company that doesn’t beat the CULTure drum. Our culture is organic and derived of doing good work for good people with good people. Our team is relaxed and empowered. Big things are coming in 2019. Stay tuned.

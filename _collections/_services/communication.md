# Communication

For any successful relationship to work communication has to be a top priority. When we work together we'll go out of our way to ensure everyone is on the same page at all times.

## Customer Service

We pride ourselves in how we work with our customers and that's just not talk, we'll show you! As we work together you'll find we're a team of friendly and personable folks. Through the ups and the downs of our project we will do whatever it takes to keep everyone happy.

## Open Lines

It's important we're able to talk freely and openly. Is something bothering you? We encourage you to bring it up with us so we can address the issue! Likewise if something isn't right on our end we want to be able to bring it up. When we can communicate like that it should be smooth sailing.

## Email & Calls

We're flexible when it comes to how our communication takes place. Sometimes it makes sense to just send over a quick email and other times it's easier to hop on a call to collaborate. Typically we'll have a regular check in call as well just to make sure everyone is on the same page.

## Sharing

Throughout a project there are multiple instances where we need to exchange some information. We try to make this process as easy as possible! For instance we use the service Invision for sharing designs. For sharing your content we'll ask that you have it organized and cleanly formatted. Our goal with sharing is to ensure things are simple, easy and nothing gets lost!

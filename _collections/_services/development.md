# Development

Where design leaves off development picks up to ensure your amazing looking website functions flawlessly. Our developers can engineer endlessly complex features but our philosophy is grounded in reliability, security and performance.

## Frontend

Great design only goes so far. It’s on our frontend developers to bring the design to life in the browser. They’re specially skilled to interpret these visuals and code them up so they’re just as gorgeous, work across many devices and in modern web browsers. They also get to bring a special touch to the website adding in the mobile views, animations and other elegant touches. 

## WordPress

When it comes to content management solutions we strive for the best. That’s why we use WordPress to power your website’s features and deliver the content. Not only does it power over 30% of the internet but it also has a robust community. This allows us to build fast and powerful websites. Websites we create are so easy to manage - no engineering degree required here!

## Features

Every website has some unique bits of functionality that make it a challenge — a fun challenge! We have the experience to make these features a reality. Whether it's an eCommerce store, a user portal or complex API integrations with CRM services we can help you. We believe in writing clean and bug free code that will be safe and reliable into the future.

## Search Engine Optimization

An important but little known function of a developer when it comes to building websites is ensuring they're optimized for search engines. This means making sure HTML tags are properly organized, 301 redirects are in place and the pages load fast.

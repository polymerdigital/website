# Support

Beyond design and development the support we provide you with for your website is the glue in our relationship. We love helping you launch and take care of your website.

## Hosting Setup

Whether we're launching a brand new website, updating your old one or replacing it we have the experience to work with your host of choice. And, if you're in the market for a new web host, we can make recommendations and help you migrate.

## Bug Fixes

Just like cars it seems like the older a website gets the more things break. We're more than happy to help you fix any issues you might be having with your website, even if it's not work we did previously.

## Content Entry

It happens all the time. An event is coming up, you have a press release to publish, but you just don't have the time to spend creating the new post in WordPress. Don't take time away from what you do best when you can leave it to us to update or add content to your site! Simply send over a document with your content changes and we'll get it taken care of for you.

## Estimates & Troubleshooting

Are you having an issue with your website? Would you like to know what it'd take to add something new? We're here for you! We'll happily take a look and provide you an estimate with what it'll take to fix an issue or build a new feature.
